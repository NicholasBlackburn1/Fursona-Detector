3. to provce the furry communjityu with a costomized reconitioon system based on fursuit
4. learn train anbd inprove accercy and speed to kinda be on par with YOLO V4 but for furries



### Training the model's data 

1. All data trained on by this model was found at furtrac With my wwebscrapper to scape the webite for single  furry shots
2. Using this time to research and dev the best solution for classifiying furries fursuits 


Now on to the Structure of the models data

## whats happening sop faor 
1. got web scraper working 
2. got the model training
3. working on backround bluring for cobing the furry model 




## DataCollection

For the data set we  need to collect a bunch of different fursonas with their tag and sort them bi spiese the best place to do this is furtrac a furry fursona database.


**IMPORTNAT Model Creation STEPS**


- Collect
- Aggregate
- Beutifiy
- Train 



We **collect** the data and sort it into its own catagory, **AGGEGATE** it and then we Comb threw it and **Beutifiy** it which means remove junk data from the collected data and then we **Train** the model.

and im currently working on getting the beutifiyer working
